	<p class="teal-body">In an effort to connect patients with accurate educational resources, Dr. Mehta installed Outcome Health technology in his office in 2015.

	Outcome Health is the leading provider of decision enhancement technology that drives better health outcomes by transforming physician-patient communication.</p>

	<p class='teal-body'> In today’s increasingly consumer-driven healthcare market, patients have high expectations for their care experience. These empowered patients are also turning to a variety of channels for health information, but finding relevant resources can be challenging.

		<h3>
		Starting the conversation in the waiting room
		</h3>

		<p>As a private practitioner in an increasingly competitive market, Dr. Mehta understands the importance of developing a strong rapport with new and existing patients, and delivering on a great experience. He believes that connection should begin the moment patients enter his practice.  
		<br><br>
		Outcome Health’s digital waiting room screen has helped Dr. Mehta significantly enhance the patient experience, engaging patients while they wait for appointments with targeted health information. 
		<br><br>
		To showcase The Endoscopy Center’s services, Dr. Mehta has developed professional video content about the practice, his GI expertise, and his commitment to partnering with patients to manage their care. The digital waiting room screen features unlimited content customizations, allowing Dr. Mehta to display his own videos, important office reminders, and staff introductions. 
		<br><br>
		Walking into a physician’s office can be a stressful experience and sharing this information in the waiting room helps patients feel more comfortable. “If patients see a sound bite of me talking about general medical information in the waiting room, they feel more at ease when they do meet me,” Dr. Mehta says.

	<h3>Creative a collaborative experience in the exam room</h3>
	<p>
		Consultations are a critical time for patients to feel comfortable, tell their stories, ask questions, and understand their health options. The digital wallboard has significantly improved Dr. Mehta’s ability to communicate procedures, symptoms, and disease states to patients. 
		<br><br>
		The digital wallboard, which is placed in exam rooms, features more than 80 condition-specific and anatomical illustrations that physicians can annotate, zoom, and rotate to help patients make informed decisions. 
		<br><br>
		In one of Dr. Mehta’s consultations, he recommended a colonoscopy for a patient experiencing certain symptoms, but the patient feared the procedure would be too invasive. Using the digital wallboard, Dr. Mehta showed the patient how the scope would pass through the colon, where he might take a biopsy, where polyps can form, and how he would remove them. 
		<br><br>
		The patient agreed to the colonoscopy, and Dr. Mehta found and removed a colon polyp in the patient’s colon, alleviating the patient’s symptoms, and reducing the risk of colon cancer.
